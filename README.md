# Mozilla Network Site API

This is the REST API server for the Mozilla Network Site.

## Requirements

The only requirement to run this API is Docker and its dependencies (which you can [download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker)). Make sure you have port 5000 open as the API is exposed on that port.

## Setup

To build and run the API, simply run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
You should now be able to access the API on `localhost:5000`.

Any changes you make in the `app` directory will automatically be reflected in the docker container.

**Note:** If you change anything involved the build (for e.g. change the requirements), you will need to run `docker-compose up --build` so that it will re-build your container with the changes.

As this is a Python/Django project, we also support additional commands that might be of use. To run a command, simply run:
```bash
docker-compose run web sh -c "<command>"
```
where, `<command>` (don't forget about the surrounding quotes) should be replaced by any one of the following:

| No. | Command | Description |
| --- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1. | flake8 . | Run Flake8 linting on the code.  |
| 2. | python manage.py test | Run the tests defined for this project. |
| 3. | python manage.py makemigrations | Create migration files for all Django model changes detected. |
| 4. | python manage.py migrate | Apply migrations to the database. |
| 5. | python manage.py shell | Open up a Python interactive shell. |
| 6. | python manage.py createsuperuser | Create a super user for the Django administrative interface. |
| 7. | python manage.py collectstatic | Create a folder containing all the static content that needs to be served for use by the API and the admin interface. |
